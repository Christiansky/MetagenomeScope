Think about what resources in the video editing lab are available.
Camtasia might be a useful piece of software for recording things on my
computer; it's free through UMD (Windows/Mac only tho; OBS seems like a
reasonable alternative for Linux).

RESOURCES TO USE?
-Desktop computers for screencasting (they have software available)

-The tablets with handwriting/screen capture might be good for recording MgSc
stuff -- could "draw" on the graph, etc. Similar to football commentators? if
that makes sense

-Greenscreen: could be used for chroma keying me talking in front of the
assembly graph?

PART 2 (using the web interface)
Given: .db file for SRS049950 graph (make available for download from GitHub
pages site and from the wiki)
==========
-Load file
    -Discuss distinctions between demo .db and choose .db file
-Assembly info
-Component selectors
-Draw a component
-Zoom using mouse scrolling
-Pan using click+drag
-Click to select contig
-Click to select edge
-Click to select cluster
-Ctrl+click or ctrl+click+drag to select multiple elements
-Collapsing and uncollapsing clusters
-Search for elements

One small video or multiple small videos? ==> Multiple small videos, probs.
e.g. settings dialog (incl. node colorization),
scaffold stuff (incl. finishing + AGP stuff), ...
