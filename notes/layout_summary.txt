STANDARD MODE
For each connected component:
1) Lay out each cluster (bubble, frayed rope, etc) by itself.
    -The loop that does this is in line 2223 in collate.py, although
     the actual layout operations happen on line 550 in graph_objects.py.
2) Lay out each connected component, using the size information obtained
   from step 1 to generate "dummy nodes" for all clusters.
    -This happens on line 2274 in collate.py.

SPQR IMPLICIT MODE
For each connected component:
1) Lay out contigs within each bicomponent.
    -This happens on line 885 in graph_objects.py in
     Bicomponent.implicit_layout_isolated(), which is invoked (for all Bicomponents
     in the connected component) on line 1772 in collate.py.
2) Lay out the entire graph for the connected component, with "dummy nodes"
   used to represent bicomponents.
    -This happens on line 1904 in collate.py.

SPQR EXPLICIT MODE
For each connected component:
    I. For each bicomponent:
        1) Lay out contigs within the metanodes in the bicomponent.
            -This happens on line 717 in graph_objects.py, which is invoked for
             all metanodes in a given bicomponent on line 925 in graph_objects.py
             (in Bicomponent.explicit_layout_isolated()).
        2) Lay out metanodes within the bicomponent (the hierarchy between S, P, R
           nodes).
            -This happens on line 942 in graph_objects.py, again in
             Bicomponent.explicit_layout_isolated(). This is the one invocation of
             dot (instead of sfdp) in the SPQR layout code.
    II. Lay out the entire graph for the connected component, with "dummy nodes"
        used to represent bicomponents.
        -This happens on line 1904 in collate.py.
