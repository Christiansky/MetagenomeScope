Install Instructions -- MetagenomeScope
=======================================

Hi! These instructions are for installing the preprocessing script component
of MetagenomeScope, which can be used to generate .db files that can be
visualized in MetagenomeScope's viewer interface.

(The viewer interface is just a normal web application -- you shouldn't need to
install anything in order to use that, assuming you're using a modern web
browser with Javascript enabled.)

Hopefully these instructions should be sufficient for getting everything up
and working, but if you run into any problems please feel free to contact me
at the email address "mfedarko at umd dot edu" (with no quotes, and with the
"at" and "dot" replaced with @ and . respectively).

External Libraries Required
---------------------------

1. Python 2.7 (higher versions of Python 2.x should work, I think)
2. NumPy
3. Graphviz
4. PyGraphviz

1. Python 2.x is installed by default with many systems.
   Installation instructions for Python (as well as instructions for checking
   to see if you already have Python installed) are located here:
   https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download

2. Installation instructions for NumPy are located here:
   https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html

3. Installation instructions for Graphviz are located here:
   http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php
   NOTE that we recommend using a version of Graphviz dated on or after
   2.41.20170712.0019, due to a bug in edge routing that was fixed before
   that release. (Details regarding this issue are available at
   https://github.com/fedarko/MetagenomeScope/issues/235, if you're curious.)

4. Installation instructions for PyGraphviz are located here:
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygraphviz
   It might be easiest to install PyGraphviz through "pip" or another Python
   package manager.

Compiling the SPQR Script
-------------------------

The bulk of MetagenomeScope's preprocessing script's functionality
is contained within its Python code (which is generally easily portable across
different platforms). However, the "SPQR script" in MetagenomeScope (written
in C++) requires compilation, since it uses the Open Graph Drawing Framework
(OGDF) to generate SPQR trees.

I'm working on getting a proper Makefile set up for the SPQR script.
I still need to implement a better system for linking OGDF's code
(maybe it'd be best to include OGDF headers/code in a ogdf/ folder in the
root directory of MetagenomeScope? That'd prevent users from having to
separately download OGDF, I suppose).

For the time being, though, you can replace the arguments in the OGDF_INCL and
OGDF_LINK variables in the Makefile to point to your own installation of
OGDF's corresponding include/ and _release/ directories.
You can also modify the COMPILER and CFLAGS arguments if you're using a
different C++ compiler.
