PURPOSE

MetagenomeScope is a visualization tool intended to aid in the analysis of
metagenomic assembly and scaffold graphs. It consists of a preprocessing
script (implemented in Python and C++) and a web-based visualization interface
(implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS). The C++ component of the
preprocessing script is linked with:
