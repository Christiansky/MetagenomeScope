PURPOSE

MetagenomeScope is a visualization tool intended to aid in the analysis of
metagenomic assembly and scaffold graphs. It consists of a preprocessing
script (implemented in Python and C++) and a web-based visualization interface
(implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; also referred to as the "viewer
interface").

The C++ component of the preprocessing script is derived from spqr.cpp in
MetaCarvel:

The Python component of the preprocessing script requires the use of the
following tools during execution, although they are not distributed with
MetagenomeScope:

The preprocessing script code was converted from Python 2 to Python 3 using
futurize as a starting point:
